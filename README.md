# cisco-switches-backup

This a very basic and simple script to backup RUNNING CONFIGRATION on CISCO Catalyst Switches. 

Note: it is ment to work fine with catalyst switches, but there should be no reson to not have it working with other cisco switches if ssh is enabled on them. 


To backup catalyst switches you need to do the following:

* Login to your linux server/pc. 
* copy this repo to your path. 
* You need to put the switch username and password in the **get-configration.sh** file -- this is the only way to have the backup working.
* make sure that all switches IPs are listed in this file **IP-list**
* Also, you need to make sure that the switch **ssh is enabled**
* run this script **get-catalyst-configration.sh**
* make sure that no errors are appeared.
* the configuration files will be listed in this path **/var/lib/tftpboot/Configrations/Catalyst-Switches** -- if this path is not exist, please create it or change the paths in the configration files. 
* In the above path, you can run ll command, if all is fine you should not see any file with 0 size.
* In case you are adding a new switch, make sure to access new switch from server for the 1st time only and then you have to follow the instructions mentioned above.

# requirements: 
* linux os 
* bash 
* expect
